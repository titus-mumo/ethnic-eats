        "The ever-shifting patterns of what people love to eat make exploring food trends for 2024 a thrilling prospect. What might food trends for 2024 have in store for home cooking, popular ingredients, beloved beverages and beyond?",
        "Thanks to imaginative culinary leanings and a sense of food-based fun, there\u2019s no shortage of tempting tastes and intriguing elements to try in the new year.\u00a0",
        "Will healthful, comforting ingredients dominate the menu of new food trends in 2024? Or will indulgent delights and exotic flavors become the specials of the day? Luckily for us all, it\u2019s a little of both! Dig into the list below and see what food trends of 2024 await you.\u00a0",

        "",
        "",
        "Addressing the issue of urban food deserts, growing ultra-urban farm produce as a food trend in 2024 will bring fresh foods to places where it\u2019s needed the most.",
        "With options for local community gardens, kitchen crops and home-based hydroponics, there\u2019s a world of novel growing methods to be explored \u2014 from rooftops to backyards to balconies. And every option provides critical access to healthy ingredients grown in responsible ways.",
        "There are myriad cooking classes near you to help you learn to create salads, sides and vegetable-forward dishes that sing with fresh flavor and goodness. There are also online cooking classes available that allow you to explore food trends in 2024 from the comfort of your own kitchen.\u00a0",
        "Sustainability will continue as an element of many food trends in 2024, just as it was a key food trend of the past few years. The availability of ingredients farmed responsibly with lower-impact growing methods will expand the movement in important ways.",
        "Leading the charge: grains and other crops grown with concern for soil health, creating an easier environment for continued cultivation. Increasing interest in plant-forward dining will also carry forward the idea of careful cuisine. And the explosion of non-meat protein alternatives continuing into next year will highlight a desire for mindful options among the many food trends of 2024. Learning to prepare food this way may be an adjustment, but once you get started, you'll find the options are abundant.\u00a0",
        "",
        "",
        "Following the pattern of many other food trends of 2024, those with the means to purchase pasture-raised meat and eggs may be interested in making the shift. The reason is multi-faceted: Environmentally-destructive factory farms have fallen out of public favor over the past several years, with more consumers looking to purchase meat and eggs from small, local farms where animals are raised ethically with plenty of space and natural diets.",
        "There's also a health component. Compared to factory-farmed livestock, pastured animals are less likely to suffer dangerous bacteria outbreaks such as e coli, staph or salmonella. Quality is also significantly higher; FACT reports that grass-fed beef contains less saturated fat, lower levels of inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids and higher levels of vitamins than grain-fed beef typical of a commercial farm.",
        "There can be a premium to buying pasture-raised, but as many folks move away from meat-focused diets, they are more willing to pay for higher quality in smaller quantities. Give it a try with this churrasco steak recipe with fresh chimicurri. We're likely to see this continue as a food trend in 2024.",
        "A splash of tropical sunshine will add some much-needed joy to our eating habits this year! Look for a fusion of traditional and island ingredients to create a food trend in 2024.",
        "A rise in popular picks such as pineapple and passionfruit, as well as more adventurous options like coconut curry and Caribbean spices, will help turn simple dishes into unique experiences. And beverage flavors taking a turn toward the floral and fruity will help make the new year an escape to paradise.\u00a0",
        "We Recommend:",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "Heating up traditional sweet bakes with chipotle, cayenne and other hot spices will set food trends in 2024 on fire! You\u2019ll see heated flavor favorites like Mexican hot chocolate, mango habanero and chili raspberry popping up in the form of cakes, cookies and pies. It\u2019s an earthy element that brings a sense of gourmet theater to all sorts of baked goods.",
        "It\u2019s also a fun and easy way to add complexity to familiar flavor profiles. Why not experiment with a little cayenne in your cupcakes to lend your sweets a little heat? It's a fun way to spice up date night \u2014 like in date night cooking classes in Calgary \u2014 or you could even try an online baking class for a little boost in inspiration!",
        "As noted by Cambridge University Press, it's well documented that excessive meat consumption, especially red and processed meats, has damaging effects on our health and environment. Limiting your consumption of animal-based foods is at the heart of the reducetarian movement. Rather than going fully vegan or vegetarian, this food trend for 2024 embraces thoughtful moderation. It\u2019s a great transition for mindful diners working toward a more environmentally conscious way of eating.",
        "With incredible alternative meal options available in both ready-to-eat and easy-to-make forms, shifting away from animal food sources will be an easier, more delicious decision to make. If you're new to the movement, try this Korean tofu soup (soondubu jjigae) for an easy 30-minute meal.",
        "While we\u2019re turning up the heat in the new year, expect BBQ food trends in 2024 to bring the fire, too! Expanding our domestic BBQ palate, flavors from global cuisines will be lending their magic to traditional BBQ options in the coming year.",
        "Regional spice profiles with smoky and peppery notes from the Middle East, the Mediterranean, South America and Asia will be rising in popularity. Look for an uptick in Korean and Thai BBQ techniques to provide some exciting fusion flash to your usual BBQ sensibilities.\u00a0",
        "If you live in a BBQ haven, local chefs can even help you sort out fusion flavors blending classic American BBQ with international flare. Check out cooking classes in St. Louis or cooking classes in Denver for a start. And while you're at it, why not up your cutlery collection for the best knives to slice and serve your favorite BBQ options? We recommend the Cuisine::pro Sabre 9-Piece Knife Block Set or Calphalon Classic Self-Sharpening 15-Piece Cutlery Set.",
        "You may have heard the term \"girl dinner\" online recently and wondered what it was all about. Girl dinner is an eating style based on low effort and high satisfaction. The concept is nothing new, though the name is. When you're not in the mood to cook but want to nourish yourself, you have girl dinner, creating a personal mini-buffet of the foods you love.\u00a0",
        "More than a snack plate but less than a meal, girl dinner originated last year when TikToker Olivia Maher responded to a video in which the speaker described the typical meal of peasants \u2014 bread and cheese \u2014 as undesirable. Maher responded with, \"But that's my dinner!\" and posted her own video, dubbing her simple but satisfying repast as \"girl dinner.\" This glorified snacking trend is going to stick around well into 2024.",
        "2024 is winding up to be the year of culinary upcycling. This environmentally conscious initiative involves cooking with trimmings, food scraps and other parts of fruits and vegetables that typically get tossed out (but don't need to be!). Culinary upcycling is a great way to familiarize yourself with recipes that help fight food waste. It can also expand your palate so you can take advantage of the variety of flavors, nutrients and textures you usually miss out on with conventional food prep techniques.",
        "We Recommend:",
        "",
        "Butter is definitely having its moment in 2024. Last fall, TikTok creator and recipe developer Justine Snacks (Justine Doiron) took foodies by storm with a viral video in which she spread thick pats of butter across a serving board and topped it with all sorts of sweet and savory mix-ins.",
        "Inspired by a technique by chef Joshua McFadden, \"butter boards\" are perfect for entertaining and serving a crowd, letting guests swipe breads, fried dough pieces, crackers or even crudit\u00e9s through the flavorful swirls of butter. You can go the sweet route with honey, fresh berries, dried fruits or flowers, or jams, or opt for savory instead with fresh herbs, chili crisp, chimichurri, crumbled bacon, roasted garlic or nuts. The combinations are limited only by your imagination.",
        "",
        "",
        "Another of TikTok's biggest food trends in 2024 comes in an unlikely place: tinned seafood. We aren't just talking about the average can of tuna, either. Taking notes from traditional Spanish conservas (top-quality foods preserved in cans or jars), trendy tinned fish includes octopus, squid, mussels, mackerel and more. You'll often find these selections preserved in sauces or with herbs, or sometimes smoked.",
        "Not only delicious, accessible and a wonderful addition to a snack board, tinned fish can also be a health-conscious addition to your pantry. Seafood is a great source of protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Shellfish such as mussels and oysters are an excellent way to up your intake of zinc and vitamin B12. Plus, since so much tinned seafood consists of smaller-bodied, non-predatory fish (sardines, mackerel, squid, mussels, etc.), you can breathe easy knowing the mercury content is much lower than what you'd find in regular servings of large fish.",
        "Try some spread on crackers, flaked over salad or eaten alongside a loaf of good bread and a glass of your favorite wine. You may also find tinned fish courses cropping up at popular eateries, which you can sample on food tours in NYC, food tours in Las Vegas or food tours in Chicago.",
        "Expect international peppers of all shapes, sizes and heat profiles to get things sizzling in the coming year. They\u2019ll be making appearances in snacks, exotic condiments and exciting seasonings; so if you don't know how to eat hot peppers, now's the time to learn!",
        "Don\u2019t be surprised to see adventurous flaming hot flavors expand beyond chips and popcorn. Fast food outlets, food trucks and even home cooking options will have their own spiced-up versions of hot offerings as a food trend for 2024, including mac and cheese and fried chicken. If you want to crank up the heat in your own recipe rotation, hook up with a local chef for cooking classes in Napa, cooking classes in NYC or cooking classes in Toronto.",
        "With substitutes available that can stand in for eggs in both function and flavor, vegan eggs are a thrilling new food trend for 2024. They\u2019re practically identical when used in omelets or quiche and make low-cholesterol baking a foolproof success.",
        "And if you\u2019re comparing nutrition facts, a serving of plant-based eggs has the same calorie and fat content as a serving of traditional eggs, and only one gram less of protein. When paired with plant-based chicken, beef and pork options, they round out a conscious swing toward animal-free eating that will continue to grow in 2024 and beyond.\u00a0",
        "",
        "Think outside the chocolate box to find a fun chocolate-based food trend for 2024! New colors and flavors such as gold and ruby bring a sense of elegance to the chocolate experience.",
        "These flavors are nothing like your favorite milk, dark or white chocolate. Ruby chocolate carries a sweet-to-tart berry flavor profile, while golden chocolate tends toward caramel and toffee notes. And their hushed tones add elegant and exciting colors to the chocolate spectrum. Experiment with them when baking, creating home confections or for a celebratory anniversary date idea for a sweet, upscale twist.\u00a0",
        "",
        "",
        "According to Healthline, this small, pebble-skinned fruit helps reduce inflammation and promotes heart health. It also packs a powerful antioxidant-and-vitamin one-two punch for its size, similar to a mandarin.",
        "This power fruit can also be found in juice and jams, as well as in whole form in grocery store produce sections. And with a taste profile more sour than citrus, it can easily replace lemons and limes for a tangy kick in all sorts of recipes, from salads to desserts. Look for it to become a prominent superfood as the new food trends of 2024 roll out.\u00a0",
        "Medical News Today touts moringa as a source of numerous vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, vitamin B3, calcium and iron. It\u2019s a healthful ingredient that aids in everything from treating mood disorders to reducing high blood pressure.",
        "Leaves from this highly valued plant, also known as the drumstick tree, will be found in salads and used as teas as food trends in 2024 prove out. Though fresh moringa may not be widely available, a powdered version can be found in health food stores, perfect for including in shakes and smoothies.",
        "Several studies, like this one in Foods, have proven the curcumin compound in this umami spice to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. That makes it one of the healthiest seasonings you can have in your spice rack.",
        "You\u2019ll see an uptick in its use as a food trend for 2024, showing up in everything from turmeric lattes to cereal. Its slightly mustardy profile makes it an ideal addition to eggs, soups, stir-frys and other savory dishes. Sprinkle it on popcorn or include it in hummus for an extra-healthful kick. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can even try a golden hot chocolate with turmeric as the star ingredient!\u00a0",
        "Being a star ingredient in Indian cuisine, these dishes are a great place to start familiarizing yourself with turmeric's earthy flavor profile. Get expert insight from world-class chefs with cooking classes in Vancouver, cooking classes in Columbus and more cities near you.",
        "Expanding the alternative protein movement, plant-based chicken will be a star player of the food trends in 2024.",
        "Fast food chains are testing versions in select markets, hoping to expand their options beyond beef patties. For home cooking options, you\u2019ll find newer and better versions cropping up in national grocery chains. Look for a wider selection of tenders, strips and even fried chicken alternatives to become sensations in the new year.\u00a0",
        "",
        "",
        "Welcome back a favorite comfort dish as a food trend in 2024! Expect a push for healthier versions that bring a sense of culinary well-being to the usual pasta experience.",
        "It isn\u2019t just Italian pasta making waves this time: international flavors from North Africa, Eastern Europe and Turkey will be showing up in the new year. You\u2019ll also see a turn toward healthier base ingredients, grains, pulses and legumes such as spelt, flax and even chickpeas. Add hearty toppings and sauces prepared with plant-based ingredients and you have a food trend for 2024 we can all get wrapped up in. Become a pasta making master with cooking classes in Orlando, cooking classes in Orange County and beyond.",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "When it comes to upmarket beverage flavors, watch for elderflower, lavender and other natural floral flavors to add to the food trends of 2024. These delicate essences bring a fresh profile to drinks that supplants the need for added sweeteners.",
        "Expect herbaceous and greener flavors to come forward as well, highlighting a cultural shift toward food and drink trends featuring more natural flavorings. Even familiar, earthy botanical spirits like amaro and absinthe will be seeing an uptick in the new year. If you're feeling at all stumped on how to hop on the trend yourself, the five-star mixologists leading online mixology classes are happy to share their recipes.",
        "Other beverages will see a return to simplicity with dominant single-note flavors as a food trend for 2024. Nostalgic candy flavors like cherry, green apple and watermelon that bring a sense of carefree childhood indulgence are on the horizon.",
        "Though nuanced flavors have made beverages feel upscale and exclusive in the past, these more direct flavor profiles with fewer bells and whistles are easier to recognize as familiar tastes. It marks an important return to comfort as a response to the increase of general life stress from the past few years.",
        "Expect a step up in the fizzy water trend of the past few years with a blast of wellness-minded additions. With elements of ginger and citrus introducing natural ingredients, seltzer takes on a more useful purpose than simple refreshment.",
        "There\u2019ll be upmarket versions of traditional colas as well, with elevated flavor profiles, vitamins and minerals added, and sugar removed for a more mindful beverage experience. Kombucha is also expected to continue its wave of fizzy fermented popularity for health and general enjoyment.\u00a0",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "Clean labels with fewer ingredients will be dominating the beverage market as a food and drink trend in 2024. Many beverage makers will be doing away with artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners. Though this isn\u2019t a new idea, the increased interest in health exhibited by consumers due to COVID-19 has brought it to the forefront.",
        "This trend will affect soft drinks and colas as well, with vitamin-fortified and naturally sweetened versions of classic offerings being rolled out in the new year.\u00a0",
        "Joining other plant milks on grocery shelves as delicious alternatives to dairy, potato milk will be seeing its stock rise among food trends in 2024.",
        "This unexpected ingredient is low in saturated fat and sugar and presents the most sustainable version of non-dairy milk yet. It may sound like an unlikely contender, but with a creamy consistency and neutral flavor that can be sweetened easily, watch for potato milk to stake its claim in the beverage case this year.\u00a0",
        "One of the most exciting beverage-based food trends of 2024 is the turn to zero-proof spirits. They present all the flavor with none of the alcohol, making them a perfect replacement for beverage lovers opting for less of a buzz in the new year.",
        "They\u2019re available in various flavors that mimic their alcohol-based counterparts. And they blend easily with your favorite bar elements to become friendlier versions of familiar cocktails. It\u2019s a fantastic compromise for the health-minded drinker and an inclusive way to jazz up parties, get-togethers or girls night ideas.",

        "Many of the issues that dogged the UK\u2019s dining scene in 2022 did so throughout 2023 \u2014 particularly the high cost of food, which continues to have a big impact on how and what we\u2019re eating. This is being felt most notably in the capital, where food costs are compounded by high and rising rents, contributing to what many food writers have cited as a sense that restaurants are playing it safe, at least within the city centre. As the Guardian\u2019s food critic Grace Dent put it in her end of year review, \u20182023 seemed to be the year that London\u2019s restaurant scene lost its edge. Outside the M25, I was eating far better\u2019. This sense of caution can be seen among many of the trends widely cited for 2024, with humble ingredients and classic creations seeing a return in popularity. Perhaps this is why the martini is back in fashion and beans are more prevalent on the menus of hip restaurants \u2014 albeit both with fresh twists and interpretations. For all this, though, there are still plenty of exciting developments, such as the rise of music-led restaurants and fresh ingredients to explore, such as the fig leaf. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on the horizon for 2024.",
        "The humble fig leaf is the surprising new must-have ingredient for chefs \u2014 the leaves are being used in everything from ice cream to curry. The leaf can\u2019t be eaten raw, but its sweet, creamy, herbaceous flavour can be infused into oils and dairy, or even made into syrups as a cocktail ingredient. Simon Rogan\u2019s Aulis features a fig leaf parfait with white chocolate and mint; east London\u2019s hot new opening, Papi, serves oysters dressed in a fig leaf mignonette; new Mayfair bar Nipperkin has a fig leaf and butter cocktail; and Parafante offers a bottled fig leaf negroni to drink at home. Given the versatility and abundance of the fig leaf (they\u2019re easy to forage), we\u2019re sure to be seeing more of them in 2024.",
        "Hot sauce hype has been building for years, but retailers are currently reporting a huge increase in demand \u2014 at Waitrose, sales are up 55%, while independent specialist retailer Hop Burns & Black reports a huge 94% rise. Why the sudden surge? Waitrose notes the trend of using hot sauces in home cooking for a quick flavour hit, while Hop Burns & Black thinks, \u2018demand has been driven by the growing interest in world cuisine, and the desire to explore flavours from around the world\u2019. Both retailers, however, attribute a large part of the craze to the success of YouTube show Hot Ones, where celebrities are interviewed while they eat chicken wings doused in a succession of sauces that get progressively hotter \u2014 customers are even buying the specific Hot Ones sauces to recreate the challenge at home.",
        "London\u2019s restaurants are alive with the sound of music \u2014 and it\u2019s no longer just the chef\u2019s playlist of 1980s tunes that\u2019s keeping diners entertained. Increasingly, music and high-spec sound systems are being put front and centre of the dining experience. Newly opened Bambi in London Fields has vintage Tannoy speakers, a huge wall of records on display and a music programme curated by Charlie Dark MBE, including live DJs who spin tunes to accompany casual small plates from chef Henry Freestone. Another new spot, in Dalston, mu, offers live jazz and Cuban bands alongside Japanese-inspired izakaya dishes; while in Newington Green, there\u2019s Stella\u2019s, the butcher shop that turns into a listening bar with charcuterie and wine on weekend evenings. It\u2019s a trend being played out across Europe, too, from Bambino in Paris to Cornerstore in Amsterdam.",
        "It\u2019s an unprecedented time to expand your whisky horizons beyond the big four of Scotland, Ireland, America and Japan and discover pioneering drams from surprising, less \u2018traditional\u2019 destinations. The Young Turks of the whisky world can currently be found in New Zealand, the Nordic nations, France and Italy \u2014 there, whisky makers are drawing on centuries of distilling expertise and invigorating the \u2018classic\u2019 category. Meanwhile, closer to home, the English whisky scene has been quietly maturing into one of the world\u2019s most diverse and innovative. \u2018Not hamstrung by history nor tethered so tightly to tradition, English distillers are able to innovate with measured abandon,\u2019 wrote The Thinking Drinkers in the Spring 2024 edition of Food by National Geographic Traveller\u00a0(UK): \u2018They\u2019re also embracing pioneering ageing techniques, modern distilling processes and, crucially, celebrating provenance.\u2019",
        "As restaurants look for additional revenue streams beyond simply serving dinner, we\u2019re seeing more and more restaurant-branded condiments and sauces come on to the market. As Ren\u00e9 Redzepi gets ready to shut Noma for good at the end of this year, his new Noma Projects arm has been producing wildly inventive things from its test kitchen, from smoked mushroom garum to corn yuzu hot sauce. In the UK, Bao offers bottles of plum pickle ketchup and burnt chilli sauce; from Poon\u2019s you can pick up XO sauce and chilli vinegar dressing; and Gymkhana has just launched its Michelin-level curry sauces in Whole Foods Market. Bottling sauces is also a great way to use up ingredients: Fallow has its own super sustainable sriracha made with leftover English chillies, and Rocks Oysters will launch an oyster XO sauce in 2024 with chef Ana da Costa, using excess oysters that would otherwise have gone to waste.",
        "Beans and pulses have gone from basic and bland to star ingredients in recent months: cans of butter beans and chickpeas are flying off the shelves at Waitrose and the new deluxe Bold Bean Co jars have been all over social media, resulting in a 650% increase in sales in the last year. But why now? As an ingredient, beans and pulses certainly tick a lot of boxes in the current economic climate \u2014 they\u2019re cheap, versatile and nutritious, being low in fat and high in protein. Their popularity is also part of a wider trend of smashed veg and pulses, as restaurants and diners seek out alternative toast toppings to the environmentally problematic avocado. Meanwhile, chefs have shown that beans needn\u2019t mean boring, with indulgent bean-based dishes being put centre stage. At Bambi, there are braised butterbeans with kale and goat\u2019s curd, while hot newcomer Leo\u2019s has white beans with cockles, lemon and olive oil on the menu.",
        "P\u00e9tillant naturel \u2014 or pet nat, to use its cute nickname \u2014 is a traditionally made semi-sparkling wine that\u2019s bottled while it\u2019s still fermenting. And while it\u2019s by no means a household name in the UK, it\u2019s growing in popularity in fashionable wine bars. Food by National Geographic Traveller UK\u2019s wine columnist Fiona Beckett explains: \u2018Hazy, fruity and generally low in alcohol, pet nats bring a year-round taste of summer to your table and the colourful funky labels take the snobbery out of drinking. What\u2019s more, English winemakers are making them, too.\u2019 Beckett recommends Lost in a Field\u2019s Frolic p\u00e9t nat as a good option for those new to the style.\u00a0",
        "If small plates defined the past decade (at least) of dining out, now it could be the turn of showstopping large sharing dishes, which are becoming increasingly favoured. At Tomos Parry\u2019s new restaurant Mountain, the signature dish is a lobster caldera stew for three or five to share; Llama Inn offers lomo saltado, a huge plate of Peruvian beef stew topped with fries and served with scallion pancakes; while whole roast chicken has stolen the show at new openings such as Dovetale, Story Cellar and B\u00e9b\u00e9 Bob, which specialises in the dish. Offering value for money for the diner, simplified service for the kitchen and, let\u2019s face it, an attention-grabbing visual for social media, it\u2019s easy to see why these centrepiece dishes are catching on.",
        "The martini is about as classic as they come, but the cocktail is fashionable again according to the Diageo 2024 trends report, which claims it\u2019s \u2018enjoying a cultural moment on social media\u2019. It certainly seems as though creative martini serves are everywhere right now: in New York, Temple Bar has a dozen variations including the Bilbao martini, which contains a drop of anchovy oil, and at elNico there\u2019s a tomato martini with sun-dried tomato-infused vermouth and basil oil. In London, two sub trends have proven popular: Tay\u0113r + Elementary and new Peruvian restaurant Llama Inn offer \u2018one sip\u2019 martinis served in shot glasses; and both Ever After and Hawksmoor are serving martinis at sub-zero temperatures straight from the freezer. Taking this to the extreme is Mimi Kakushi in Dubai, which has a pre-bottled martini encased in a block of ice at -20C, which is then chiselled out by bartenders for each order. Meanwhile, Food by National Geographic Traveller UK\u2019s drinks columnists, The Thinking Drinkers, are predicting a similar resurgence for classic gin brands. \u2018As with the martini, expect classic gins to benefit from an appetite for nostalgia,\u2019 they explain. \u2018Now the dust has settled following the stampede of flavoured and wacky gins, it\u2019s time for gin\u2019s illustrious juniper-driven founding fathers, such as Beefeater, Tanqueray and Plymouth to step up.\u2019",
        "As part of the wider trend for nostalgic comfort foods, hash browns are being seen in increasing frequency appearing on restaurant menus. But don\u2019t expect to see crisp, golden brown triangles on your plate \u2014 chefs are giving them a serious upgrade. Jackson Boxer serves an oblong hash brown topped with whipped cod\u2019s roe and kosho at his new Selfridges restaurant; new opening, The Dover, has a hash brown snack topped with caviar; and Dorian in Notting Hill embellishes crisp fried potato with crab. Meanwhile, last November, Hash Hut launched at KERB Seven Dials Market, offering three different hash brown shapes to choose from and a whole host of toppings, from sriracha mayo and parmesan to crispy onions and nori flakes.",
        "As the market for fake meats appears to be plateauing, amid an increasing wariness of ultra-processed foods, natural alternatives are back on the table \u2014 and king oyster mushrooms are ruling the day. The thick stem and meaty texture of this particular fungi appeal to chefs, who are using it to create everything from mushroom \u2018scallops\u2019 (at Glas in Dublin) to panko-crusted rings of \u2018calamari\u2019 (Willow in New York). Expect more next year, too, as roving supper club Holy Carrot opens its first permanent site in Notting Hill, complete with king oyster mushroom \u2018wings\u2019 in a crispy gluten-free spicy coating and served with miso butter.",
        "The ongoing trend for lower alcohol drinks grows ever stronger, with no-lo beers and gins in particular hitting new heights. Meanwhile, recent UK duty change has made it more attractive to make wines with a lower ABV. \u2018An 8% wine only incurs \u00a31.49 duty compared to \u00a32.67 on a wine of 11.5% or over,\u2019 writes Fiona Beckett. \u2018There does tend to be a loss of structure and intensity in lower alcohol wines \u2014 and this suits some styles, such as mosel riesling and New Zealand sauvignon blanc, certainly better than most reds. Lower alcohol wines also tend to be generally sweeter.\u2019",
        "A classic French toast swimming in maple syrup is a brunch stalwart \u2014 but your weekend brunch in 2024 is just as likely to feature a savoury version of the dish. Nigella, ever the trend setter, has a superb recipe for parmesan French toast with Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce, which she suggests is just as good at dinner as it is for breakfast. No33 in Norwich tops French toast with mushrooms and spinach in a creamy brie sauce with parmesan, crispy onions and balsamic. And Notting Hill\u2019s Eggbreak now offers a savoury French toast with za'atar, cherry tomatoes, garlic, thyme, poached eggs, labneh and pickled onion, finished with a drizzle of hot honey (itself a trend we highlighted in 2023).",

        "Many consumers still appreciate a hot, soft piece of bread. They\u2019re also broadening their horizons to incorporate more healthful and whole grain options than ever before.",
        "The tradition lives on \u2013 we\u2019re still drooling over fresh bread made in-house! There are more options than ever, and health-minded consumers might be eager to see gluten-free bread, ancient grains and more on the menu.",
        "Andrew Camellini, the chef of NoHo Hospitality and Rye Street Tavern in Baltimore, recommends:",
        "For the last few years, chefs are sourcing more seafood locally, knowing you can actually get higher-quality fish nearby rather than importing it. Together, we maintain an awareness of environmental impact by serving up different species.",
        "Fish-free \u201cfish\u201d dishes have also become more popular with guests who prefer plant-based ingredients, and offering these dishes provide another opportunity to conserve wildlife. These Baja Beer Battered Fish Tacos call for shark (dogfish) fillets, which is a fun way to break out of the salmon and shrimp bubble.",
        "Chefs aren\u2019t just cooking up a \u201cclassic dish from Germany\u201d anymore \u2013 they\u2019re differentiating recipes from Brandenburg versus Bavaria, and the consumers love it!",
        "Guests enjoy feeling a part of various cultures, especially if they find a particular culture in their own genealogy. Creating delicious hyper-regionalized recipes and describing them in detail on the menu gives our guests a chance to learn more than ever before\u2077.",
        "Side note: Hyperlocal cuisine is also still vastly popular. Many consumers prefer the freshness of real foods grown or raised right around their homes.",
        "Many customers are aware of the benefits of all things natural \u2013 nontoxic professional cleaning products, organic fruits and vegetables, and hormone-free meats.",
        "Organic, grass-fed, grass-finished, hormone-free\u2026 consumers are calling for a change in the meat industry. They are ready and willing to pay more for meat that comes from healthy animals. When a chef can put \u201c100% grass-fed and grass-finished\u201d on the menu, they are going to make some health-conscious individuals very happy.",
        "It can be challenging to acquire organic meat, when it only takes up 1.4% of the meat market, and organic poultry can be even more difficult to find. Fortunately, most consumers understand the cost will be higher and are willing to pay the difference\u2078.",
        "Side note: Red meat has gained popularity over the past couple of years, due to trending diets like paleo, keto and high protein.",
        "Consumers consistently care about our food safety practices and that we\u2019re serving up delicious cuisine, but their diets are always evolving.",
        "Good news: It appears that the keto diet isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 billions of people follow the ketogenic diet, and those numbers are predicted to increase each year\u2079.",
        "Here are some ways to accommodate more keto dietary restrictions:\u00a0",
        "To make matters even simpler, you could tweak your menu just slightly to offer keto versions of your usual hits. For example, the keto version of this Pan Seared Cod with Purple Kale recipe would be almost the same \u2013 just hold the beans and rice!",
        "On the flip side of the keto diet is the ever-growing demand for plant-based cuisine. Consumers want to see menus full of colorful plant-based proteins, healthy bowls and specialty veggie-burger blends.",
        "Meatless meat dishes and snacks have also become popular. It\u2019s a good time to try out meat alternatives made from fruit and veggies (like mushrooms, pea protein, and soy protein) and flavor them with sweet and savory spices, from chili to cacao.",
        "One of the biggest plant-based foods is the humble chickpea. No, the chickpea\u2019s run is not done! We can expect to see:",
        "Of course, we can always appeal to health-conscious consumers by bumping up the vegetable ratio in our dishes, especially if they\u2019re organically-grown, foraged or sustainable vegetables!",
        "An excellent meat-free dish featuring the favored chickpea would be a Middle Eastern Chickpea and Swiss Chard Bowl with Delicata Squash, Pomegranate and Pistachio.",
        "Consumers care more than ever that we\u2019re doing a little extra for our planet. They\u2019re interested in how we\u2019re disposing of our food to our food safety practices and which professional cleaning products we\u2019re using.",
        "Some of the things that Samantha Kincaid and Jon Nodler, chefs and owners of Cadence in Philadelphia, recommend:",
        "What professional cleaning products do you like to use in your kitchen? Seventh Generation Professional products are gaining popularity because they\u2019re not just environmentally friendly \u2013 they truly work.",
        "Upcycling is another modern food trend that\u2019s absolutely soaring, with an industry worth $46.7 billion\u00b9\u00b2. Making food from ingredients that would have otherwise been thrown out both salvages waste and protects the environment. Upcycling includes creating snacks, drinks, sauces and more from unused food.",
        "For example, Pulp Pantry creates chips using vegetable juice pulp, and Scraps Frozen Food upcycles broccoli leaves, bruised basil leaves and imperfect-looking peppers to make sauces for their pizzas.",
        "At the end of the day, the American consumer is more conscious now \u2013 more conscious about what they are putting into their bodies, and more conscious about the impact their food and professional cleaning products have on the environment.",
        "As long as we\u2019re remaining conscious with them, we will be able to update our menus and practices to accommodate their needs and preferences.",
        "Simply taking the time to read up on modern food trends shows that you care for your customers, take your food safety practice seriously, and serve your community well.",
